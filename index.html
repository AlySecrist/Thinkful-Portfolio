          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>As you might have guessed, my name is Alyssa (Aly) Secrist, and I'm located in Southern Minnesota. I love a good challenge and figuring out puzzles or general problem solving, and the best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't, so coding makes quite a nice fit for me. I can be deeply caring and completely logical and objective at the same time, and pride myself on being able to see "both sides of the coin".</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a new student of web development, my knowledge of coding is pretty limited, but I am beyond excited to learn all that I can! It didn't take me long to figure out that coding is one of the most satisfying things I've ever done and I can't wait to join a team of knowledgeable developers to continue learning long after graduation. As one who gets bored easily, I feel like I've finally found a career path that will not only be fulfilling, but that will captivate my attention and hold on to it. Everything is always evolving in tech and I just wish I'd found my passion for it sooner!</p>

        <p>Outside of coding and school, I'm pretty much "Abby" From NCIS - bubbly, nerdy, and a little gothy. I'll listen to most music, but metal is, by far, my favorite and I love tattoos and piercings and creepy things; but I also love Disney Princess movies, *NSync, and video games...and have 6 cats because they're too cute and I can't help it, haha!</p>
