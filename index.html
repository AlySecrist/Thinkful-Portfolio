          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>As you might have guessed, my name is Alyssa Secrist, and I'm located in Southern Minnesota. I love a good challenge and figuring out puzzles or general problem solving, and the best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't, so coding makes quite a nice fit for me. I can be deeply caring and completely logical and objective at the same time, and pride myself on being able to see "both sides of the coin".</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a student of web development, my knowledge of coding is fairly limited, but I am beyond excited to learn all that I can! It didn't take me long to figure out that coding is one of the most satisfying things I've ever done and I can't wait to join a team of knowledgeable developers to continue learning long after graduation. As one who gets bored easily, I feel like I've finally found a career path that will not only be fulfilling, but that will captivate my attention and hold on to it. Everything is always evolving in tech and I just wish I'd found my passion for it sooner!</p>

        <p>Outside of coding and school, I'm pretty much "Abby" From NCIS - bubbly, nerdy, and a little gothy. I'll listen to most music, but metal is, by far, my favorite and I love tattoos and piercings and creepy things; but I also love Disney Princess movies, *NSync, and video games...and have 6 cats because they're too cute and I can't help it, haha!</p>

            <p>This is the first project I completed in school. It's a simple, one page website built with HTML and CSS designed to introduce myself to the tech community and anyone looking to know a bit more about me, in addition to giving me an opportunity to practice my skills.</p>

            <p>In building this particular project, I discovered the importance of color contrast so that, in addition to being semantic and technically accessible, it can also be visually accessible. There are still a few things that need tweaking, and this will likely be a project that I continuously update throughout my career.</p>

          <p>The Harry Potter Quiz is a short, 5 question trivia quiz based on the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling.It was built using Javascript and JQuery, HTML, and CSS for anyone interested in testing their basic Harry Potter knowledge, or a quick laugh.</p>

          <p>This project taught me how to personalize UX so that the user feels more welcomed and involved by asking for the user's name and returning that input throughout the quiz by calling the user by their provided name.</p>
